## Overview
Starts requesting interstitial ads from the server.  
  
*Note:* you should call startRequestingInterstitials() only once. The interstitial rotation is handled automatically by the SDK. Each time a new interstitial is received the "received" event is dispatched to your listener function. You only need to call startRequestingInterstitials() if the SDK received a memory warning (and freed the memory occupied by interstitial) or if an error occurred and "failed" event was dispatched.


## Syntax

	gpn.startRequestingInterstitials( )


## Examples

``````lua

    -- start requesting interstitial after you've initialized gpn instance
    gpn.startRequestingInterstitials()
        
``````
